                    <p>
                        Chase founded Ult Fit as a new type of training studio. Chase follows the 2mm Rule. If you make a 2 millimeter shift, you'll completely change your trajectory. Small movements have massive results. Squat 2mm deeper. Run 2mm further. You'll end up at a new destination faster and stronger.   Make the 2mm shift to show up at Ult Fit, and your life will never be the same.

                        We reserve Jenna for only the most committed clients. Her intense training programs show results so fast and so long-lasting that she's received the nickname, "The Miracle Worker." She lives and breathes physical activity as a professional volleyball player, yoga instructor, dance teacher, marathon runner, and of course an Ult Fit personal trainer.

                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Martin's known for his "one more" lie. He believes in pushing his clients to do one, two, or five more reps than they think is possible, because that's where all the growth happens. Martin is professionally trained in basketball and rugby, and he loves working with athletes and clients who want to train for endurance and performance. Plus, you'll love Martin's puns.
